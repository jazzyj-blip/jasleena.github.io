  <h1>Cross-Section of Earth's Mantle</h1>
  <h2>An Interactive Data Visualization</h2>

  <h3>Project Description</h3>
  <p>
    In this project, I aim to create an interactive data visualization that explores the internal structure of the Earth mantle in a way that is both scientifically accurate and engaging for users.
  </p>

  <p>The visualization will focus on the main subdivisions of the mantle:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Upper Mantle</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Transition Zone</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Lower Mantle</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Each of these layers will be represented with their relative depths, thicknesses, and key physical characteristics such as temperature ranges, composition, and density.
  </p>

  <p>The interactive component of the visualization will provide:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>scalable cross-section`</strong> with clearly labeled layers.</li>
    <li>A <strong>depth scale</strong> to contextualize the information.</li>
    <li><strong>Quick facts</strong> that can be revealed through hover or click interactions.</li>
    <li>A <strong>depth slider</strong> that allows users to highlight specific depths of interest dynamically.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The overall goal of the project is to communicate complex geophysical information in a clear, accessible, and visually compelling way. By using interactive elements, users will be able to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare the relative thicknesses of different mantle layers.</li>
    <li>Understand and visualize how physical properties change with depth.</li>
    <li>Quickly interpret data without needing prior geoscience knowledge.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This project is especially suitable for a data visualization course because it combines several important elements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accurate domain data</strong> from earth sciences.</li>
    <li><strong>Clean visual encoding</strong> to make abstract concepts tangible.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessible interaction design</strong> that supports exploration and learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Reproducible code</strong> with a short and explainable structure, making it easy for others to adapt or extend.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Ultimately, this visualization aims to bridge the gap between raw scientific data and intuitive understanding, enabling both students and the general public to explore Earthâ€™s mantle in an interactive and educational way.
